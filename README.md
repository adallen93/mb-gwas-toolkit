## Description

We want to create a custom python library to handle statistical analyses for GWAS, which is a "genome wide association study". The github repository will include source code, as well as providing tests. Before using our source code, the user must be ready to provide cleaned genome sequence data. By "cleaned", we mean that the data should have mean imputed missingness, be filtered for minor alleles, and has had its population structure analyzed. Our source code will contain four functions.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Create a custom python function to conduct GWAS analysis. (Austin and Jonathan) 

### Phase 2: Create custom code to correct for multiple testing and determine significance threshold (Austin and Julia) 

### Phase 3: Create custom code to create a manhattan plot (Julia and Jonathan) 


### Phase 4: Provide tests to this function (Everyone).
