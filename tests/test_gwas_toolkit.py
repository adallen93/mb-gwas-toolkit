# Jonathan's Comments for Julia
# Show that the parse data function works well.
# Build tests to show all the GWAS_Object functions work.
#     The tricky thing: build tests proving that plot functions print plots.
#     This is pretty hard, but I think you can do it!
# Build tests that raises all error conditions.
# For some of these tests, you need to call data_for_testing.csv.
# But most of these tests don't need data_for_testing.csv.
# Instead, you can make your own toy data to prove, eg., that an error occurs.
